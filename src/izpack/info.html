<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>I am having issues, it crashes. How can I fix this?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Try the following things:
* Make sure you unzip your program before running it, otherwise it won't be able to find any of the files it needs
* Upgrade java to its latest version, earlier java version don't work very well with this program
* Try to generate the scripts locally, and copying them manually the the tf/cfg directory in the team fortress installation directory
* Post an explanation + screenshot (if applicable) with the crash/issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What is viewmodel switch mode?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off if that is set for the weapon slot:
* Immediately after switching weapons
* After firing a weapon
* After switching strafe directions
* After either firing or strafing</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>I have a feature request, where can I post it?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Post any suggestions on the github page or in the thread where you found the program</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What does medic radar do precisely?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>It toggles medic autocall to 150%, so each of your teammates has a medic symbol above their heads, which you can see through walls. As soon as you let go of the button, it will go back to its original autocall level</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>How can I customize this even more?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You could try editing the original templates, in the template directory. First, delete the cache directory. Then edit the templates, the language used is ssp: http://scalate.fusesource.org/documentation/ssp-reference.html. After that, the program will use your editted version of the templates. </p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What other ways to customize tf2 are there?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can install custom huds, skins, hitsounds or customize/make your own scripts</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>My ambassador crosshair disappeared, how can I fix this?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>For some reason, the crosshair after shooting is about half the default size. Increasing the size of the spy primary crosshair should fix this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Changing settings inside tf2 doesn't work, it just gets changed back. How can I change my settings?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The scripts that were installed now regulate most of your settings inside tf2. Change stuff through the program, and then reinstall the scripts, or uninstall the scripts and be free to change things inside tf2 again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Can I use my settings from a version of your program before 1.0</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes. Drag the settings.xml file from your old program into the profile folder of the new program. Now you should be able to load your settings from the profile menu.</p>
