Installation:

* Download the program here: https://github.com/downloads/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator/YATF2ConfigGenerator-0.8.zip
* Make sure you have a new version of the java runtime (1.6 or higher would probably work) installed, this is a version without toolbar crap: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1637588.html
* Unzip the program and double click on the jar file to start
* Set everything up the way you want to, make sure you copy most of your essential settings in tf2, like your mouse sensitivity (very annoying when that gets changed)
* Select your steam directory and username and save the configuration files to tf2

FAQ:

I am having issues, it crashes

Answer:

Try the following things:

* Make sure you unzip your program before running it, otherwise it won't be able to find any of the files it needs
* Upgrade java to its latest version (from the link provided in the installation instructions), earlier java version don't work very well with this program
* Try to generate the scripts locally, and copying them manually the the tf/cfg directory in the team fortress installation directory1

It still doesn't work

Answer:

Post a screenshot with the crash in the thread, make an issue on my github page: github.com/logophobia/YetAnotherTF2ConfigGenerator or add me at steamcommunity.com/id/logophobia

What is viewmodel switch mode?

Answer:

It indicates when the viewmodel is turned off, immediately after switching weapons, after firing, after strafing or after either firing or strafing

I have a feature request

Answer:

Post any suggestions in the thread or on the github page

What other ways to customize tf2 are there?

Answer:

You can install custom huds, skins, hitsounds or customize/make your own scripts

Todo:

* Check bind conflicts
* Make the GUI a bit prettier (javafx instead of swing maybe)
* Rewrite code to be a bit (a lot) prettier
* Other requests?

Known Bugs:

* When building as an engineer, if you start building, then switch weapons before putting the building down, the crosshairs will get out of sync, switch weapons once to fix
